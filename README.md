# Optical-Character-Recognition

Multiple convolutional neural network models with different architectures are presented
in this paper, trained and evaluated in the MNIST dataset. The goal of the study is to compare
the accuracies achieved by the different models. The paper confirmed that a dropout layer
not only reduces overfitting but can also increase accuracy, and it also covered how well the
estimation is, which was given by the 5-fold cross-validation.
